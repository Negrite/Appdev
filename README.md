### REVIEWS
>A Walk to Remember is based on the book by Nicholas Sparks. Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, a Christian and daughter of a Baptist minister. Shane West plays "bad boy" Landon Carter. Pair are inexorably drawn together as they navigate their way through high school.
## CONCLUSION

`A Walk to Remember is an antidote to Hollywood's raging cynicism about Christian values. Jamie Sullivan achives it while holding on to her faith, her father and her values. While Christianity is usually presented as illness one must recover from, A Walk To Remember vehemently disagrees with that diagnosis.`
